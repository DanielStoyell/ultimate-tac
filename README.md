# Ultimate Tac

[Ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe) is an expanded variant of regular tic-tac-toe, where 9 tic-tac-toe boards are embedded within a single, larger board. To win a square on the larger board, you must win the corresponding smaller board.

This project is mostly an attempt to build an AI for it.
